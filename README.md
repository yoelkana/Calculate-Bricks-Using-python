This is my first GitHub.
I hope it's all right along the way

I want to upload my code about this scenario

Scenario: 
Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.
Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall - it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.

The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders:

Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.
Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers - if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

1. Sample input: 6
Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 3

2. Sample input: 20
Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 5

3. Sample input: 1000
Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 44

4. Sample input: 2
Expected output: The height of the pyramid: 1
